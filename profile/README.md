**MyFursona** is a work-in-progress open-source platform to keep track of your fursonas, adopts, and artist commissions! Using modern web technologies, our goal is to make sharing ref sheets, managing art commissions to artists, and adoptables a breeze!

Progress is still ongoing as we're only 3 passionate developers from around the world making this project a reality; if you'd like to help out with the development process, feel free to open a pull request! Any type of feedback is appreciated!
