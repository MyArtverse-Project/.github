## About MyFursona

**MyFursona** (usually prefixed as MF) is a work-in-progress open-source social media platform to keep track of your fursonas, adopts, and artist commissions! Using modern, bleeding-edge web technologies, we aim to make sharing ref sheets, managing art commissions to artists, and adoptables a breeze - combining the likes of FurAffinity and Toyhouse!

## Why MyFursona?

- `üì¶` **Character repository**: You can organize your characters (or [fursonas][wp:fursonas]), including character bio, different iterations (i.e. clothing, props), etc. from its own dedicated page!

- `‚ôªÔ∏è` **Integration**: MyFursona provides a seamless way to migrate your content from existing accounts from Toyhouse, FurAffinity, Weasyl, and much more!

- `üñåÔ∏è` **Managing commissions**: For artists, instead of relying on multiple third-party platforms for your commission prices and queues, MyFursona gives you the tools to build a site for free and a familiar Kanban-style tool like Trello to manage and automate commissions!

- `‚ö°` **Built on modern web technologies**: The website is written from the ground up on a robust and battle-tested web framework, [Next.js][nextjs], ensuring a better experience for both end users and developers alike!

- `‚ôø` **Accessibility**: MyFursona is committed to making the platform as accessible and screen reader-friendly as possible.
