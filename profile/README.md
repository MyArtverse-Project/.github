**MyFursona** is a work-in-progress open-source platform to manage and store your fursonas! Using modern web technologies, our goal is to make sharing ref sheets to artists and making characters' ref sheet a breeze!

Progress is still ongoing as we're only 3 passionate developers from around the world making this project a reality; if you'd like to help out with the development process, feel free to open a pull request! Any type of feedback is appericiated!

## Infrastructure

- We use TypeScript and Python as our programming languages; Nuxt 3 to build the site; Vercel and Cloudflare to currently host the site; Strapi and PayPal for processing payments; and PostgresQL as our database! We're still not sure where we host our backend yet, either looking at platforms such as DigitalOcean or ory.sh.
  
- We also use Python for advanced image manipulation and our recommendation algorithm.
