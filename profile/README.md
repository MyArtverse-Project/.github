## About MyArtverse

**MyArtverse** (prefixed as MF) is a work-in-progress open-source social media and art platform to keep track of your fursonas, adopts, and artist commissions!

Our mission is to streamline the process of commissioning a digital art piece as frictionless as possible - combining the likes of FurAffinity, Weasyl, and Toyhouse!

## Why MyArtverse?

- `üì¶` **Character repository**: You can organize your characters (or [fursonas][wp:fursonas]), including character bio, different iterations (i.e. clothing, props), etc. from its dedicated page!

- `üñåÔ∏è` **Managing commissions**: For artists, instead of relying on multiple third-party platforms for art bases, YCHs, commission prices, and queues, MyArtverse gives you the tools to build a site for free and a familiar Kanban-style tool like Trello to manage and automate commissions!

- `‚ôªÔ∏è` **Integration**: MyArtverse provides a seamless way to migrate your content from existing accounts from Toyhouse, FurAffinity, Weasyl, and much more!

- `‚ö°` **Built on modern technologies**: The website is written from the ground up on a robust and battle-tested web framework, [Next.js][nextjs], ensuring a better experience for both end users and developers alike! The desktop client is built on [Tauri][tauri] for a direct management method.

- `‚ôø` **Accessibility**: Atop of building MyArtverse with modern web technologies; MyArtverse is committed to making the platform as accessible and screen reader-friendly as possible.

## The Problem

![Banner January 2024 alt](https://github.com/MyFursona-Project/.github/assets/94678583/2e720010-d480-45b2-904e-2f6971036645)

Nowadays, most artists jump from numerous platforms such as a dedicated website they built from Caard, WordPress, Webflow, etc., to manage commission queues and statuses on a Kanban-style list app like Trello, and whatever social media the artist prefers to communicate between the client and the artist.

In terms of practicality, an artist's productivity is effectively decreased by hopping from platform to platform. There's no way to set things automatically (e.g. when the user fulfills payment, then adds the user to the queue) and have to do things manually unless they have the technical know-how to write a script that suits their workflow.

So we created MyArtverse; a platform that automates commission management, client communication, and more. It seeks to eliminate manual work by merging tedious tasks into one platform. This means artists can focus more on their craft and let MyArtverse handle the rest!
